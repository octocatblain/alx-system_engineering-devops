## Learning Ovjectives

This project aims to prove my web stack so that there is redundancy for my web servers. This will allow me to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make my infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, I will still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, the bash script will automate my work. All scripts are designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.
